                Back for another year, every night, the Sunny Acres Corn Maze
                becomes the Sunny Acres Haunted Maze. This season's maze begins
                with an encounter with an evil organist (played by the Council
                Bluff Choir's own Glenn Frye). Explore the maze and find the
                zombie graveyard, the pumpkin tower, and a haunted house made of
                corn, not to mention the spiders, ghosts, witches, and other
                assorted villainy that inhabit the maze.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Haunted Maze is open the last three weekends of October with
                a special event on Halloween. Come early in the day to explore
                the larger Corn Maze, stay for a homemade meal of brats and
                burgers, soda, and chips, and then participate in the Halloween
                Festival. Special stations will be set up in the Haunted Maze
                for trick-or-treaters. A smaller maze is also available that is
                "scare-friendly" for younger children.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the sun goes down this time of year, we're all looking for
                a good fright. Sunny Acres provides that too with another year
                of the Haunted Maze. Please plan on joining us during weekends
                in October or on Halloween for our big Halloween Festival.
